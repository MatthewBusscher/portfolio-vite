        details: `My journey as a developer began in 2019, where my love for technology led me to experiment with the firmware of Xboxs and Amazon firesticks. I loved the idea of being able to modify and customize these devices to my liking. But little did I know, that was just the tip of the iceberg. One day, I stumbled upon the concept of coding and that's when I had my "aha!" moment. I realized that with coding, I could not only modify the firmware of Xboxs and Amazon firesticks, but I could create my own digital world from scratch. So, I typed my first line of code, "print("Hello World")" and it was like a switch flipped in my brain. I was hooked and I couldn''t get enough of it. From that moment on, I dove headfirst into the world of coding, learning new languages, and building my own projects.`
